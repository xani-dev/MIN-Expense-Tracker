# MIN - A beautiful Expense Tracker

## Description

A multi-user MERN full-stack App designed to track expenses, uses Firebase Authentication. With a Minimal UI design. It was created as an MVP, with focus on the Transaction List CRUD.  

It's been set-up with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), for styling used the styled-components package, and material-ui components package. 

For Form management I utilized Yup and Formik packages. 

I also made use of React Hooks and ReactRouter.
